# Fitness EDA Project

---

## Overview

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on fitness and activity data. 
The project aims to uncover meaningful insights by answering three key questions:

---

## Assigned Questions

1. **Did intensity and calories burned decrease over time? (Assigned to Mike)**

2. **Does more sleep lead to higher activity and calorie burn the next day? (Assigned to Dave)**

3. **Which exercises are most effective for calorie burn? (Assigned to Kashif)**

---

This project will analyze patterns and correlations in fitness-related metrics such as activity intensity, calories burned, sleep, and exercise effectiveness using Python and visualization techniques.

## Key Tasks

The project consists of the following major tasks:

	- Data Preparation:

		- Importing datasets for activity, sleep, calories, and exercise.
		- Cleaning and merging data for consistent formatting and completeness.

	- Data Exploration:

		- Identifying trends in intensity and calorie burn over time.
		- Analyzing the relationship between sleep and next-day activity.
		- Evaluating exercise effectiveness using calories burned per minute as a metric.

	- Data Visualization:

		- Creating visualizations such as scatter plots, line graphs, and bar charts to present findings effectively.

	- Results Export:

		- Summarizing insights into visual and written formats for presentation and reporting.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
	- git clone https://github.com/CCIEMikeG/Fitness-EDA-Project.git

2. **cd Fitness-EDA-Project**

3. **Set Up the Environment:

	- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
	- Install required libraries by running:
	- pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Run the Notebook:

	- Open the relevant Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks folder using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
	- Execute each cell sequentially to replicate the analysis.
	- Dependencies

---

## Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

	- pandas
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- seaborn
	- jupyter
	- scipy

## Results

The analysis aims to uncover insights such as:

	- Trends in activity intensity and calorie burn over time.
	- Correlations between sleep and next-day activity levels.
	- Ranking of exercises by calories burned per minute.

As progress is made, detailed findings and visualizations will be added to the repository.
